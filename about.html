    <p class="lead">
      Nimbus Cloud Slides were created with a simple idea: everyday footwear should feel as soft
      as walking on clouds, without looking bulky or cheap. We wanted slides that you can wear
      to the gym, on a flight, or to grab food — and still feel put together.
    </p>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Every pair of Nimbus slides is built around comfort, durability, and clean design. We use
          high-quality EVA foam to keep each step cushioned while staying lightweight. The shape is designed
          to support your foot and reduce pressure during long days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of chasing complicated designs, we focus on a few essential colors and a streamlined silhouette.
          That makes Nimbus slides easy to style with almost anything in your closet.

      <h3>Why We Started</h3>
      <p>
        Nimbus began from noticing a problem: most budget slides either feel terrible after a week
        or fall apart fast. On the other hand, premium brands charge a lot more without always
        delivering real comfort. We wanted to bridge that gap — slides that feel premium,
        look clean, and stay affordable.
